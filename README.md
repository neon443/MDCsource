# MacDirtyCow AltSource

### Add https://neon443.github.io/mdcsource to your sources list

I created this AltSource because there was a stunning lack of AltStore sources that contained all of our favourite MacDirtyCow apps. 

## Apps included

### Cowabunga:
A Jailed toolbox application for iOS 14.0-15.7.1 and 16.0-16.1.2 using CVE-2022-46689.

### FilzaEscaped

### SantanderEscaped
A new, enhanced File Manager for iOS devices with the tccd exploit for full file access.
Santander aims to enhance the experience of a file manager on an iOS device, using modern and familiar UI alongside new APIs.
The project is still in beta, and there still quite a lot of bugs to fix & enhancements to make.
