# MacDirtyCow AltSource

I created this AltSource because there was a stunning lack of AltStore sources that contained all of our favourite MacDirtyCow apps. 

## Apps included

### Cowabunga:
A Jailed toolbox application for iOS 14.0-15.7.1 and 16.0-16.1.2 using CVE-2022-46689.

## Apps not yet included, I plan to do so once I get a functioning repo with cowabunga alone

### TrollBox16

### ResSet16

### DynamicCow
Enable Dynamic Island on every device that is running iOS 16.0 to 16.1.2 using the MacDirtyCow exploit.
Note: iOS 16 is only supported because older ios (15/14/13) lack the system resources to run the island.
