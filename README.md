# MacDirtyCow AltSource

I created this AltSource because there was a stunning lack of AltStore sources that contained all of our favourite MacDirtyCow apps. 

## Apps included

### Cowabunga:

### SantanderEscaped
A new, enhanced File Manager for iOS devices with the tccd exploit for full file access.
Santander aims to enhance the experience of a file manager on an iOS device, using modern and familiar UI alongside new APIs.
The project is still in beta, and there still quite a lot of bugs to fix & enhancements to make.

Enable Dynamic Island on every device that is running iOS 16.0-16.1.2 using the MacDirtyCow exploit.
iOS 15/14/13 are NOT and will never be supported, as this is NOT a tweak. If you have one of the above listed iOS versions, please stay away from it cause it can bootloop your device.
